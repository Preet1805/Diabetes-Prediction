# Loan-Prediction
The objective of our project is to predict whether a loan will default or not based on objective financial data only and whether investors should lend to a customer or not. Data from 2007-2015 will be used because most of the loans from that period have already been repaid or defaulted on.
The provided dataset corresponds to all loans issued to individuals in the past from 2007-2015. The dataset has 855969 observations and 73 features. The data contains the indicator of default, payment information, credit history, etc. Customers under 'current' status have been considered as non-defaulters in the dataset. We have also been provided with a Data dictionary that best describes the features. 
The dataset has quite a lot of missing values and the figures can be considered as ground truth, but lots of columns are either irrelevant, very sparse or non informative. Moreover, the dataset is unbalanced, with approximately 6% of loans considered as defaulted.
